Name: Heather Turner   
Country I am currently in: UK  
Something we could do or discuss together today:   

Name: Tomasz Gieorgijewski  
Country I am currently in: Poland  
Something we could do or discuss together today: bugs I'm fixing, translations (Mac GUI especially), next things, testing fonts  

Name:  Gergely Daroczi  
Country I am currently in:   Hungary  
Something we could do or discuss together today: nothing particular other than translation patch submitted to R Core, and we might need more detailed docs on glossary -- it came up a few times on Slack

## Discussion

### Brief catch-up

- Report back on recent R Dev Days
- Discussion of securely saving information for Weblate (HT to follow up on this)

### Translation

- TG has been working on Polish translations on Weblate. Also involved Lukasz Daniel who worked on translations previously.
- Mac GUI strings have been translated. 
    - How do updates for the Mac GUI work? Someone needs to manually open PR. Normally done quarterly, but GD can do in between times on request.
    - Okay to push updates now and review later.
    - Review workflow is set up for larger languages teams - translation needs review before accepting. For smaller teams,  translations are automatically updated without review.
    - Can it be set up just for one component? E.g. Mac GUI only? GD to check: not possible, teams/reviewers can only be set at the project level -- pinged @Tomasz on Slack on how to proceed.
    - Some parts of source code on https://github.com/R-macos/Mac-GUI don't seem to have translations for all languages for which there are localizable strings. Maybe TG can open an issue on https://github.com/R-macos/Mac-GUI to ask Simon Urbanek about that. Or test with Polish translation first!
- GD will take over [open PR](https://github.com/r-devel/translations/pull/41) on translation docs to add some information about glossary.
- data.table team are discussing using Weblate for strings, manual, wiki, vignettes, etc. May be some synergy on translation team guidelines etc.
- HT talked with Mark Padgham at RSECon24 about also collaborating with rOpenSci on work related to translation. HT has passed on details of Weblate admins/translation team leads so that Mark can arrange a meeting to discuss further.
    - GD to check if glossary can be shared between weblate projects: YES, any component (so the Glossary as well) can be shared between projects.

### Bugs

- TG working on 2 bugs
    - https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18784

        - checked code for similar problems (with NULL pointers) elsewhere and not issue

        - waiting for review from Paul Murrell on patch to fix original issue

        - TG will check for related issue that Elin Waring opened relating to R code - may be Dev Day issues

    https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18787

    - https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18792
         - TG will work on this and propose a solution
     - TG learning Objective C, so he can contribute to Mac GUI issues and perhaps add features later down the line. Simon Urbanek proposed some issues to work on with graduated difficulty.
         - first PR opened here: https://github.com/R-macos/Mac-GUI/pull/16
         - Once a PR has been accepted, this might provide a good case study for the R Dev Guide, for anyone else that would like to start contributing to the Mac GUI.
    - Possible virtual R dev day as satellite to LatinR: Nov 18-22 (dates for R dev day TBA, may be spread over 17-19). This might be a chance to discuss work with Simon Urbanek.
    - R Consortium grants: https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/call-for-proposals. Should be open to proposals related to R itself, especially if there is support from R Core. TG will explore possibility of a proposal related to Mac GUI/graphics - will contact PAul Murrell and/or Simon Urbanek about this.
