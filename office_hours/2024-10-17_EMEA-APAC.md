## Discussion

### Issues with R build in RStudio on mac OS

HT: If I build R from a fresh checkout of the R sources (2024-10-16 r87241) and open in the latest RStudio (Version 2024.09.0+375), as soon as I try to run code in R (say `1 + 1`), RStudio crashes. The same version of R works fine with Positron or the terminal. I had the same issue with an older version of R-devel and an older version of RStudio (didn't note the version numbers unfortunately, but I think R-devel was from September). 

- HG: May need to get R Studio daily build to work with R-devel if something has changed that affects RStudio. [post-meeting edit: this fixed it!]

### Cross-compilation

Isabel has been working on cross-compiling for web assembly. 

Would be good to start a discussion on https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-devel or start discussion on #general channel of Slack.

List of people in R Core: https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html

People working on cross-compilation: George Stagg (WebR, https://github.com/georgestagg), Jane He (RISC-V, https://github.com/SiyaoIsHiding)

Could arrange separate meeting to discuss, or invite people to R Contribution Working Group meeting: Friday 15 Nov 2024, 3:00pm - 4:00pm UTC (see https://contributor.r-project.org/events/ for further details).

## R Dev Day @ LatinR (online)

November 18 and 19, 2024, 5:30pm - 8pm (UTC-3)

Details: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/blob/main/preparation/LatinR2024/LatinR2024_en.md

- hopefully registration will open end this week/beginning next week on https://latinr.org/

## iconv bug 

HG: Recent changes in iconv in R-devel are causing new bugs, that pop up as ERRORs on the CRAN checks. E.g.

```r
iconv("<infinity>âˆž</infinity>", to = "ASCII", sub = "")
#> [1] "<infinity>/infinity>"
```

As you can see, where only the infinity symbol was previously removed, it now also eats the following character, which makes my XML file invalid. 

- Tomas Kalibera made a change to iconv yesterday: https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/commit/1d0822ffaaea49cae09e6b6baaf9883c966e5041
- If still an issue after building R with this fix, mail reproducible example to R-devel mailing list rather than reporting a bug, as they are clearly aware of some issues. [post-meeting edit: building latest R-devel fixed issue!]
