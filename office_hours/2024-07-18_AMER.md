## Discussion

### Translations

 - Alexandros interested in translation of messages/errors/warnings as well as help files
     - Looked at https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/ to see how translations can be contributed.
     - Currently no Greek translation, though there is a contact listed on https://developer.r-project.org/TranslationTeams.html (updating this contact list is a work in progress). Can start a new translation as an individual, see https://contributor.r-project.org/translations/Weblate-FAQ.html#how-to-add-a-new-language-for-a-component, though it may be better to try to connect to one or two others (e.g. via R Contributors Slack) that also want to work on this.
     - Translations dashboard shows current status in base R and on Weblate: https://github.com/r-devel/translations-dashboard/.
         - Reviewing this dashboard and opening issues to suggest improvements or contributing improvements via PRs would be very welcome!

### Documentation

  - Can look at R's Bugzilla, specifically the [Documentation](https://bugs.r-project.org/buglist.cgi?component=Documentation&list_id=32708&product=R&resolution=---) component to find open bugs related to documentation.
  - Documentation bugs are on a tab of the [bug spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bhfPIJQXeKpydigMH79FKIkdHO9NxlBSB_bTRoCFnPY/edit?gid=0#gid=0) that is informally used by the R Contribution Working Group to triage bugs. This may help to identify good bugs to work on. You can also find this spreadsheet pinned to the #getting-started channel on the R Contributors Slack.
