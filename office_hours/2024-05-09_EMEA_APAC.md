## Discussion

### General chat

- Discussion of R User Group organization in Warwick and Cambridge
- Discussion of proposals put in for RSECon24 (https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/), including several of interest to R Contributors and community organizers - will advertise more if they get accepted!

### R Dev Day @ Imperial

 - Review of the day written up here: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/blob/main/reports/imperial2024.md
  - Heather still to write up summary of conclusions from nlme bug analysis - needs to go back to Bugzilla for wider discussion
  - Ella has patch on substr ready to submit as bug report on Bugzilla
  - Brian still interested in working on termplot issue, but contact Colin first. May be better to split into two issues so another person can pick up the second part.

      - Potentially Thomas could pick up second part, will give Colin first dibs.

   - Ella is intererested in working on the stem() function issue (https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/12) but is unlikely to do much on this before the R Dev Day @ PLUS.
   - Brian may be able to start looking at one of the issues involving C (https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AC) as preparation for R Dev Day @ PLUS

       - should consider the stem() function issue as up-for-grabs

  
### substr issue
 
 - Reviewed issue (discussed at March office hour: https://github.com/r-devel/rcwg/blob/main/office_hours/2024-03-14_EMEA-APAC.md#substr-issue-ek)
 - Walk through of documentation patch prepared at R Dev Day @ Imperial

     - updated description of arguments, details and examples

        - use tools::checkRd to check the Rd file as easy to make mistakes when editing Rd files by hand, also checks some conventions expected by R Core and other issues, e.g. encoding issues.

     - also  considered adding a warning

     - plan to submit patch and ask if patch implementing warning would be welcome
