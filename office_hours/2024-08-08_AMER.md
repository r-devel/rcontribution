## Discussion

### Vectorization in R

Whole vector of R values is passed to C, then iteration happens in C - this is why vectorization is faster than doing a loop in R.

### Learning C

gwynn is still working her way through the CS50 C material

### sample.int work possible dev day project

gwynn has been in touch with Thomas Lumley about possible tasks for the R Dev Day after posit::conf.
  - TL interested to continue work on [Enhancing sample.int for unequal probability sampling](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/issues/32)
  - Need clearer steer from Thomas on what next steps are required.

### Bug 16721

Paul suggested this as an issue for the R Dev Day after posit::conf.

The bug can be reproduced with:

```r
png("ImageWithWhiteStripe.png", width = 330, height = 200, type = "cairo")
image(matrix(1, nrow = 300, ncol = 1))
dev.off()
```

Using fill with no anti-aliasing. Hypothesis: the width of the rectangles is smaller than a pixel, so maybe if rectangle lies exactly on border 
of two pixels less than half a pixel on each side so ends up with nothing drawn in that pixel.

Could explore this bug with R code, when does it happen and when doesn't it happen?
 - need a simpler example that matches rectangle widths to pixels
 - need one with fewer rectangles so don't need to step through loop so many times!

Some intial work on useful R code snippets

```r
# Explore thin rectangles aligned exactly with pixels (or not)
library(grid)

png(width=100, height=100)
grid.rect(x=.01, width=.01, just="left", gp=gpar(col=NA, fill="black"))
dev.off()

# View a small pixel much bigger (with a pixel boundary grid)
img <- readPNG("Rplot001.png")
grid.raster(img, interpolate=FALSE)
grid.segments(0:10/10, 0, 0:10/10, 1)
```

A pointer for debugging at the C level

```c
// Print out the sequence of x-values where the rectangles are drawn
static void cairoRectPath(double x0, double y0, double x1, double y1, 
                          pX11Desc xd) 
{
    printf("%f, %f\n", x0, x1);
    cairo_rectangle(xd->cc, x0, y0, x1 - x0, y1 - y0);
}
```
