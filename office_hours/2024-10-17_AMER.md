## Discussion

### Graphics bugs

- TG has fixed a bug and got some feedback from Paul Murrell. Waiting for Simon Urbanek to check on macOS before being committed to R-devel. Also fixed one other graphics bug. Looking for more graphics bugs.
- https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17848 could be worth working on. Paul Murrell comments: Needs debugging into plotmath code to see how it is returning widths/heights for text containing newlines. plotmath is a C file in the R sources.
- Also https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16983 and https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16987 both related to grid.cap, need debugging on macOS.
- Could be useful to share code for regression testing (testing if your fix breaks existing examples in grid etc) with {gdiff}.

### LatinR

https://latinr.org/ (free!)

* R Dev Day

    * Details: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/blob/main/preparation/LatinR2024/LatinR2024_en.md

    * hopefully registration will open end this week/beginning next week.

* Talks

    * Atharva S is giving talk on R Dev Container (he will also work on adding something about the R Dev Container to the R Dev Guide)

    * Jasmine Daly and Beni Altmann will talk about the CRAN Cookbook: https://github.com/r-devel/cran-cookbook


### Graphics devices

* TG is learning more about graphics devices to be able to contribute more in this area. Plans to get some advice from Paul Murrell about this. Creating his own device as part of learning more.
