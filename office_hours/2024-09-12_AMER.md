## Discussion

### Learning C

gwynn is up to Algorithms section in CS50 C material, taking time to work on harder problems, such as Tideman problem in [Problem Set 3](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/3/).

### sample.int enhancement

Review the status of the issue [Prepare unequal sampling probability code for inclusion in base R](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/38) that gwynn and Heather worked on with Thomas Lumley at the R Dev Day after posit::conf.

 - Checked that gwynn has access to Heather's fork of the r-svn GitHub repo, where we can collaborate on a patch.
 - Reviewed gwynn's changes to `sample.Rd`, made some minor edits and committed.
 - Re-familiarised ourselves with the code developed by Ahmadou Dicko in [sondage package](https://github.com/dickoa/sondage)
      - Need to write notes so we don't have to do this each time we come back to it! [Notes started here: https://hackmd.io/@hturner/ryoM3dZaR/edit]
 - Thomas has added note to issue that C code will need to be called with `.Internal` and then register the C functions in `src/main/names.c`.  He says it would be tider to move more of `sample_pps()` to C so that only one new C function needs to be added.
     - Perhaps add code as is (as close as possible) in the first place, so we can get a working version before refactoring.
