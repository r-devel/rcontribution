## Discussion

### R Dev Day @ PLUS (after useR! 2024)

* The participants list is now up: https://contributor.r-project.org/r-dev-day-plus-2024/participants/ (there may be some minor changes before the day!)
* We will be working on issues which are being collated here: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues
  * Those marked `Imperial 2024` were worked on at a previous Dev Day and have been kept open while work is still in progress
  * Those marked `PLUS 2024` are reserved for R Dev Day @ PLUS
      * Mostly C issues so far, hope to add some more that focus on R code/documentation
      * One issue looking at work in progress on one-page HTML pages for R packages, that should eventually be hosted on CRAN. This work builds on recent developments in R 4.4 (the `tools::pkg2HTML()` function)
* We probably won't work on translation directly, as most participants want to work on code/documentation, but it remains an option.
      * useR! virtual event tutorial on contributing translations: https://sched.co/1eBe2. This is free to attend - you do not have to tbe attending useR! 2024.
* Also potential for discussions, if there is interest from participating R Core members, though it may be better to convene during useR! when more R Core members are present.
* There is a Contributing to R tutorial at useR!, but for anyone not going they can follow the video of this tutorial from useR! 2021: https://contributor.r-project.org/tutorials/

### Quick Demo of R Dev Container

* A new version will be released imminently, so Heather talked through the in-progress documentation (https://contributor.r-project.org/r-dev-env/) and briefly showed a running codespace to give an initial idea of how it works.
* Once the new version is released it should take <1 hour to work through the initial few tutorials, which got through the essentials for the R Contribution Workflow.

### Review termplot() issue 

* We talked through one of the issues from the R Dev Day @ Imperial: [Bug 17713 - spurious warning message from termplot](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/11)
  * Brian plans to work on testing the update that will avoid the warning (replacing the current condition in [L49](https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/main/src/library/stats/R/termplot.R#L49) with the body of [`has_interaction2()`])
  * Thomas plans to work on debugging why the plot is empty when the term is a valid vector that has been mistaken for an interaction (as illustrated by the initial reprex in [comment 1](https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/11#issue-2261585144) of the issue)
