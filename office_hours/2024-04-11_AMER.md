## Discussion

### Bug 18145

 - This bug was one of a few issues with `debugcall()` identified by Gabe Becker at the Bug BBQ: https://github.com/r-devel/bug-bbq/issues/2
 - Gabe already proposed a patch for one in 2020, then proposed patches for the other 3 after the Bug BBQ - one has now been closed (details on the linked issue above)
 - As patches are now 2 or more years old, it's a good idea to check to make sure that the files are compatible with current R-devel.
      - if the issues have been fixed in a different way
      - if the patches need updating (e.g. the file has been updated recently)
      - confirm that this passes make check
  - unknown as to when these bugs would be seen by R Core, but still valuable to bring up-to-date and get more familiar with development process.

### Applying/updating a patch

  - Bug BBQ README has some tips for modifying a function in base R, or creating/applying a patch: https://github.com/r-devel/bug-bbq?tab=readme-ov-file#needs-patch
      - Would be good to have this in the R Dev Guide on how to apply a patch/update it, e.g. with svn commands.
  - For modifying a function, it is best to do this from an svn checkout of the R sources, rather than using hacks to modify a function in one of the base packages 
     (note `fixInNamespace()` can't be used for functions in base R).
    
      - Could use R Dev container: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-env
    
        - Building R the first time takes about 20 minutes, but then subsequent builds are quick.
        - The documented workflow does not yet have the "applying patch" step
        - Current version assumes that you are only working with one version of R-devel
