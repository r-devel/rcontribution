## Discussion

### Compiling R

#### Using the R Dev Container

R Dev Container: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-env
 - Work through README for basic introduction, including making a change to a base R function and creating a patch.

#### Building R on macOS

Draft documentation: https://github.com/r-devel/rcwg/blob/main/working_documents/install_r_macos.md
 - Still not yet in R Dev Guide as issues giving general guidance for setting paths

Mac specific bugs: https://bugs.r-project.org/buglist.cgi?product=R&component=Mac%20GUI%20%2F%20Mac%20specific&resolution=---&list_id=28859

Mac SIG mailing list: https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-mac

### Contributing to translations

 - Contributing to Polish and Ukrainian
    - Polish translation exists and a lot of scope for contribution (currently 85% translated, 856 messages untranslated)
    - No ukranian translation of messages in base R, only messages in Windows installer (which are not on Weblate).
       - Would be good to reach out to local community, see if translation would be helpful and if there are a group of people that might contribute
       - Catalan translation has several people working on it for ~6 months, still only ~one third translated, so not trivial to add new language
       - Possible contact: person listed as Ukranian maintainer on https://developer.r-project.org/TranslationTeams.html 
 - Contribute via Weblate: https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project 
    - How to use: https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/message-translations.html#how-to-contribute-new-translations
    - Guide for translators, including glossary: https://contributor.r-project.org/translations/
        - One issue: Glossary does not seem consistent across languages, is there a way we can standardise list of terms?
