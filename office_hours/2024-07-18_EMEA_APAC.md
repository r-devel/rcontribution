## Discussion

### Tomasz' issue at the dev day

https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/17

- Issue with segfault on Quartz device on macOS, when file url has a space in the name
 - The patch has now been merged in R-devel so should appear in next release
     - Patch (shared on GitHub) is using Apple/macOS system functions - switches to one that allows spaces, rather than expecting spaces to be encoded (as "%20")
     - Added some defensive programming to check that file path exists
 - What about adding a regression test?
      - How to test for absence of segfault when file name has a space?
      - Need to write test that will work on different operating systems.
      - Should be able to spot from .Rout file where segfault occurs, if it happens.
      - Could change name of existing font file to add space, so not adding new things just for the sake of test or else one that is always there on a mac.
          - Tomasz will look into options.

What's next: Look for other places in the code where we do not check for NULLs or other failed outcomes.

 - PM: would be good to do a code review to find such things, check if defensive code needs to be added elsewhere
 - TG will search for instances of `CFRelease` as a start for this.

### What's next for bug fixing

 - PM: plans to go through Graphics bugs and look for one that are good to work on, adding next steps.
 - One from dev day: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/16
    - TG discussed this with George Stagg at Dev Day. He has R with patch so ready to do some testing.
 - Other graphics issue from Dev Day: https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/18
     - PM thinks the patch has been committed so can probably close.
 - Other graphics issues:
    - https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18654: PM has reviewed this patch of HT and has made suggestions for next iteration, also further testing on CRAN packages. Needed to find which packages uses xyTable - can use local copy of CRAN and grep, or use GitHub search on https://github.com/cran which is a mirror of CRAN (including archived packages). GitHub search can now use regular expressions: https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/github-code-search/understanding-github-code-search-syntax#using-regular-expressions. Also possible to get search results via API:

### Dev Guide

- Saranjeet plans to look at some of the open issues.
    - Quick start to the guide is outdated and not in sync with current chapters
    - Has illustration that might be used for front page, once has been published on Zenodo. Can share with and without text, as these might be useful in different contexts.
    - R Hackathon at RSECon24 could be good opportunity for working on dev guide issues, e.g. reviewing PRs.

### Abhishek

- Worked on 15027 at the dev day
