## Discussion

### Tomasz's bugs

#### 16003

Tomasz provided an example for https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16003 trying to illustrate the effect of scale argument. Paul reviewed this and suggested updates below:

```tex
  \item{scale}{character indicating if the values on the heatmap should be centered and
    scaled in either the row direction or the column direction, or
    none.  The default is \code{"row"} if \code{symm} false, and
    \code{"none"} otherwise.
    This scaling only affects the \emph{colour} scale; it does
    not scale the original data.  See the Examples.}
```

```r
rc <- rainbow(nrow(x), start = 0, end = .3)
cc <- rainbow(ncol(x), start = 0, end = .3)

## Demonstration of the 'scale' argument:
## The only change in the code is the 'scale' arg.
## The only visible change is in the color scale
## (the original data are not scaled).
heatmap(x, col = terrain.colors(128), scale = "col",
        RowSideColors = rc,
        ColSideColors = cc,
        margins = c(5,10),
        main = "heatmap(<Mtcars data>, ..., scale = \"column\")")
heatmap(t(x), col = terrain.colors(128), scale = "row",
        RowSideColors = cc,
        ColSideColors = rc,
        margins = c(5,10),
        main = "heatmap(<Mtcars data>, ..., scale = \"row\")")
```

https://stackoverflow.com/a/74139008/173755 has answer on how to link to a particular Rd section, but \linkSections{} is not in R-exts and this doesn't seem to actually work!

#### Follow-up on https://github.com/r-devel/r-dev-day/issues/17

Searching for instances of `CFRelease` - not too many examples, Tomasz has found multiple instances across ~5 C files in the R sources. Need to check context of each case to see if any fix required. Find create function and make sure all return values (including NULL) can be handled. If only one or two issues, then could be covered by single patch/bug report. Ideally have reprex that show problem plus patch that fixes it. So probably don't want too many issues on one bug report.

### Rf_error vs error

`RF_error()` is for use outside of base R (when function is exported). User `error()` in base R code.

The underscore in `_`

```
error(_("error text"))
```

is a macro used for translation.

Do we need more documentation in R Dev Guide on how to ensure messages in base R are translated?

### Hyphen-minus vs minus symbol

Prompted by: https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14878

Second comment by Ivo prompted by this Stackoverflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/q/66077931/173755 - several related discussions on Stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=r+minus+hyphen.

Unicode symbol returned when printing a negative number is hyphen-minus (`\u002d` tested with https://r12a.github.io/app-conversion/)

Hyphen-minus should be read as a minus by screenreaders but not all do it properly: https://jamescatt.ca/blog/2020/minus-the-minus-a-psa-about-screen-readers-and-negative-numbers/ - advised to use proper minus symbol where possible.

Minus symbol support added in scales package: https://github.com/r-lib/scales/issues/249 - so can use with ggplot2 ({signs} provided earlier solution: https://benjaminwolfe.github.io/signs/)

Discussed in relation to Pandoc: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/8828 - seems not taken up.

Discussed in relation to Matplotlib: https://discourse.matplotlib.org/t/minus-sign-instead-of-hyphen-in-negative-axes-labels/9060 and now minus symbol is default on axes, controlled by option: https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/unicode_minus.html.

So, some motivation here to do something - but how deep to go? A fix in axes() would only affect base graphics, not lattice or anything else. Needs more thought.
