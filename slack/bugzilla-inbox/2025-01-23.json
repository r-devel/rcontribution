The av tests fail because a WAV file converted to MP3\nends up having a much shorter duration, as reported by ffmpeg. One can\nreproduce simply using\n\nlibrary(av)\nav_audio_convert(\"t.wav\", \"t.mp3\")\nav_media_info(\"t.mp3\")$duration\n\nThe resulting MP3 file can be played and will have the original duration when\nplayed, but ffmpeg still reports something much smaller.\n\nThe problem can be reproduced without \"av\" and R on the command line using\nffmpeg utility, when using mp3_mf codec (even in Msys2 build of ffmpeg; also in\ncustom build of Rtools where the ffmpeg utility is included). This is not\nrelated to Rtools. I am checking upstream whether this is a bug in ffmpeg that\ncould be fixed. E.g. the length meta-data in the resulting MP3 file is correct\n(via mp3info), but the duration displayed by ffmpeg is wrong even using ffmpeg\nrunning on Linux. \n\nWhat is related to Rtools is that due to a typo in the build configuration, the\nmp3lame codec wasn't built, so ffmpeg only had the mp3_mf (mediafoundation)\ncodec for MP3, which was then used also by \"av\". This is now fixed in the\ndevelopment version of Rtools and av passes with that fix.\n\nRelated, to build with Msys2\/ucrt64 toolchain, av needs to query pkg-config for\nall libraries that are used by the R package, not just libavfilter. This\ndoesn't matter in Rtools where these are brought automatically due to static\nlinking, but is good for testing with other toolchains using dynamic linking. I\nended up adding: libavcodec libavformat libavutil libswresample.",
