Perhaps it can be tweaked\na bit.\n\nFor example, currently when we install binary packages on MacOS we only see the\nfollowing:\n\n```\n&gt; install.packages(\"V8\")\nalso installing the dependencies 'Rcpp', 'jsonlite', 'curl'\n\ntrying URL\n'<https:\/\/cloud.r-project.org\/bin\/macosx\/big-sur-arm64\/contrib\/4.5\/Rcpp_1.0.14.tgz>'\ntrying URL\n'<https:\/\/cloud.r-project.org\/bin\/macosx\/big-sur-arm64\/contrib\/4.5\/jsonlite_1.8.9.tgz>'\ntrying URL\n'<https:\/\/cloud.r-project.org\/bin\/macosx\/big-sur-arm64\/contrib\/4.5\/curl_6.2.0.tgz>'\ntrying URL\n'<https:\/\/cloud.r-project.org\/bin\/macosx\/big-sur-arm64\/contrib\/4.5\/V8_6.0.0.tgz>'\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n       \n\/var\/folders\/46\/wtyv3f9n7g1657wntpn0cl540000gn\/T\/RtmpeIo4bC\/downloaded_packages\n\n```\n\nIn the above output, there is no confirmation that the package installation was\nsuccessful. Instead we get a message that downloaded packages are to be found\nin some temporary directory, making it seem as if the user has to do something\nwith this? This is confusing.\n\nThe messaging could be improved by not showing this irrelevant tempdir to the\nuser. Instead install.packages() could end with a short success summary with\nthe actual installation dir:\n\n```\n  Successfully installed packages 'V8', 'Rcpp', 'jsonlite', 'curl'\n     \/Library\/Frameworks\/R.framework\/Versions\/4.5-arm64\/Resources\/library\n```\n\nAlso I think \"trying URL\" could be replaced by \"Downloading\" (stating that\nthose are URLs, and that downloads may fail, is both redundant).\n\n\nOn Windows the situation is similar except for every installation is followed\nwith:\n\n```\npackage 'jsonlite' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n```\n\nWhich is slightly more informative, although it still does not make it explicit\nif\/where the package was installed. Also on Windows the final line reads:\n\n```\n The downloaded binary packages are in\n        C:\\Users\\runneradmin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmp2ZBwka\\downloaded_packages\n```\n\nleaving the user guessing what to do next. Finally when we install binary\npackages on Linux (e.g. from <https:\/\/p3m.dev\/>) we see:\n\n```\n* installing *binary* package 'jsonlite' ...\n  * DONE (jsonlite)\n```\n\nI guess this is the most informative of the platforms.",
