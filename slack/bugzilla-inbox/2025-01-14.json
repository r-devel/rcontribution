As described here:\n<https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-dev-day\/issues\/16#issuecomment-2501503341>\nThe new alpha mask code is not behaving properly in scaled resolution but it's\nOK when in default resolution or in scaled but 4K, so equal to monitor's.\n\n2. When in scaled resolution simple plot like `plot(pressure)` produces very\nsmall plot with small fonts and points. After resizing the plot window plot\nredraws itself but still with very small fonts and points being quite\nunreadable.\n\nI checked that without external monitor on default MacBook Pro's Retina display\nthe plot window is quite large occupying half of a screen space and points and\nfonts (defaults) are large and readable.\n\nAt the same time when on external monitor only and in its default 4K resolution\ngenerated plot is small with small points and fonts, physically very similar to\nthat of scaled to 1080p.\nBut after returning to scaled resolution the fonts are resized and plot starts\nto be readable.\n\nPlease see attachment: It's taken in scaled Full HD but the plot on the right\nwas made while in Full HD and on the left was made while in 4K. Windows resized\nto match each other for comparison.\n\nWhile such behavior in scaled resolution is a surprise?\nCause the whole point of scaling on MacOS is to have bigger UI and all\napplications act accordingly to that expectation.\nExcept quartz() device.\n*(MacOS Monterey 12.7.6.)*",
