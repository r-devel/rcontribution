I usually delete\nthe older versions, but not always immediately.  In particular, R 4.3.3 and\n4.4.0 were both installed on my machine.  I also have RStudio and Visual Studio\nCode with the R extension.\n\nI often customize the install a bit, but believe I left the option to update\nthe registry in place.  The installations are administrative\/system-wide.\n\nI uninstalled R 4.3.3 via Windows' add\/remove program, which led to the problem\nabove.\n\nWork-Around\n===========\nRan `RSetReg.exe` and then deleted the duplicate keys it created.\n`VSCode` was then able to find `R`.\n\nExpected Behavior\n=================\nIf the version being deleted is not the current version, the current version in\nthe registry is left intact.\n\nIf the version being deleted is the current version, but there are other\nversions available, it would be nice if the current version were set to the\nmost recent.\n\nVersions\n========\nI tagged this as R 4.3.x since the problem occurred uninstalling 4.3.3. \nHowever, I don't know that the 4.3.3 uninstaller was run; it might have been\nthe 4.4.0 uninstaller (but it definitely removed 4.3.3, not 4.4.0).\n\nRelated\n=======\nMaybe <https:\/\/bugs.r-project.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=10746>",

It is explicitly documented in Writing R\nExtensions that R64 has the information for the last 64-bit install and R32\n(used to have) information for the last 32-bit install.\n\nThe registry mechanism exists (only) as a backup for embedded applications,\nwhen R_HOME is not defined, but it is still recommended to use R_HOME to avoid\nsurprise, because, really, the behavior when R is being uninstalled can be\nsurprising, and it is better to specify R explicitly.\n\nSo I would say that it is not at all a great idea for external tools to look\nfor R via the registry (when they are not embedding it). I think they should\nlet the user specify the concrete installation location of R desired.\n\nI have also found the reported behavior in R surprising when I saw it the first\ntime, but, incidentally I would have \"expected\" a different mechanism from the\none you describe (I would expect ordering by installation time, not by\nversion). So, clearly, it is not obviously intuitive what the right mechanism\nshould be. And in either way, the current mechanism is documented and the\naspects reported here seem to be intentional. One could argue that by removing\nthe unversioned entries on uninstallation, one reduces the amount of surprise.\n\nI also think a big value in these things is stability: I would not want to\nbreak external tools that have been carefully tuned to the currently documented\nmechanism by implementing changes that may not even be objectively to the\nbetter. \n\nIf some external tool was really dead set on automatically finding an\ninstallation of R of latest version, it may do this by looking at the\nversion-specific registry entries (following the documented behavior of the\nentries).",

It is explicitly documented in Writing R\nExtensions that R64 has the information for the last 64-bit install and R32\n(used to have) information for the last 32-bit install.\n\nThe registry mechanism exists (only) as a backup for embedded applications,\nwhen R_HOME is not defined, but it is still recommended to use R_HOME to avoid\nsurprise, because, really, the behavior when R is being uninstalled can be\nsurprising, and it is better to specify R explicitly.\n\nSo I would say that it is not at all a great idea for external tools to look\nfor R via the registry (when they are not embedding it). I think they should\nlet the user specify the concrete installation location of R desired.\n\nI have also found the reported behavior in R surprising when I saw it the first\ntime, but, incidentally I would have \"expected\" a different mechanism from the\none you describe (I would expect ordering by installation time, not by\nversion). So, clearly, it is not obviously intuitive what the right mechanism\nshould be. And in either way, the current mechanism is documented and the\naspects reported here seem to be intentional. One could argue that by removing\nthe unversioned entries on uninstallation, one reduces the amount of surprise.\n\nI also think a big value in these things is stability: I would not want to\nbreak external tools that have been carefully tuned to the currently documented\nmechanism by implementing changes that may not even be objectively to the\nbetter. \n\nIf some external tool was really dead set on automatically finding an\ninstallation of R of latest version, it may do this by looking at the\nversion-specific registry entries (following the documented behavior of the\nentries)."
