I agree this is a bug.\n\nunz() opens only files and works in a blocking manner, similarly to gzfile()\nand other *file() connections for accessing data in compressed files. The R\nprocess will be blocked when these connections wait for data to be read on\ninput (from a file), and any user R code will have to wait for data to be\ndecompressed when reading.\n\nThis report shows that when reading from a file that doesn't end in a newline\n(so has an incomplete final line), one doesn't get any data.\n\n&gt; readLines(unz(\"hello.zip\", \"hello.txt\"))\ncharacter(0)\n\nWhat should happen, and happens now in R-devel, is:\n\n&gt; readLines(unz(\"hello.zip\", \"hello.txt\"))\n[1] \"hello\"\nWarning message:\nIn readLines(unz(\"hello.zip\", \"hello.txt\")) :\n  incomplete final line found on 'hello.zip:hello.txt'\n\nThe underlying problem is that internally the \"unz\" connection in R was by\nerror left flagged as non-blocking, and then readLines() would use a pushback\ninstead of returning a partial line with a warning.
