Consistency between graphics devices (uncontroversial).\n\n2.  Consistency between graphics systems, {graphics} and {grid}\n    (also uncontroversial, but more complicated).\n\n3.  Agreeing on the correct behaviour to be consistent on\n    (currently Cairo output, but this is perhaps controversial,\n     as suggested by the \"alternative patch\")\n\nThese issues should be tackled in reverse order.\n\nA useful first step would be to establish what a \"pure\" graphics\nsystem (e.g., PDF or SVG) does in this situation.  Perhaps a set of\nhand-crafted SVG files that perform a flip plus rotation operation\nwould be helpful.\n\nOne complication is that we do not necessarily want to follow what a\npure graphics system does anyway.  R graphics does not have a \"current\ntransformation matrix\" (CTM) in the way that PDF and SVG do.  R\ngraphics has different coordinate systems, but the transformations\ninduced by those coordinate systems only affect the location and size\nof drawing; for practical reasons, the coordinate system\ntransformations do not, for example, affect the size of text or the\nwidth of lines (both of which are affected by the CTM in pure graphics\nsystems).\n\nSo having established what a pure graphics system does, we would still\nneed to consider what R should do.  Something that might help here is\na comparison with other plotting systems, e.g., a Python library.  The\nTikZ system in the TeX world also has two types of transformations\n(only one of which is \"pure\").  Thanks to Heather Turner for this\nsuggestion.\n\nAnother complication is the difference between flipping the dimensions\nof a raster image and flipping the entire coordinate system that the\nraster image is drawn within.  This is the difference between ...\n\n```\nplot(..., xlim=c(larger, smaller))\n```\n\n... and ...\n\n```\nrasterImage(..., xleft=larger, xright=smaller)\n```\n\n... and in the {grid} world, the difference between ...\n\n```\npushViewport(viewport(..., xscale=c(larger, smaller)))\n```\n\n... and ...\n\n```\ngrid.raster(..., width=negative)\n```\n\nAre those equivalent situations or is flipping the entire coordinate\nsystem more significant?\n\nIn any case, in addition to a `quartz()` fix, there will also be fixes\nrequired for `x11(..., type=\"Xlib\")` and `windows()`.\n\nAnother helpful contribution would be a test image that is VERY easy\nto identify as correct.  Just as an example of what I mean, the\n`rotate-cairo-tweak.png` attachment has added arrows to help with the\norientation of each test case.  I think this could be made better.\n\nFinally, any changes to the current behaviour would have implications\nfor backwards-compatibility (though anyone relying on current\nbehaviour is presumably not working across platforms).",
