I identified the main challenge of this work as the outreach of this guide. So the feedback was that the outreach challenge could be an entire project in itself for this program. If outreach is the priority, then I should modify my expression of interest accordingly. Say, orient it towards improving the community healthy, diversity issues, to name a few. I don't need to have a plan ready with me at this stage, as to how am I going to solve this challenge. This plan will be made during the project, through discussions.\n3. Another challenge identified was the governance of the R Contribution Working Group (RCWG). This could also be an independent project, with the deliverable that maybe we setup a steering committee for the RCWG.\n4. The project should be more focused on doing the invisible work of connecting humans to the guide instead of working on the building the guide itself. Modifying\/building the guide further could be a by-product but it should not be the main task during the incubator. The incubator is mainly designed to help improve the processes of human connections with a tech project.\n5.
