So I'm not sure if there is anything more to do on that, but there has been some follow-on work related to adding alt text to the graphics. I'm pinging <@U03CZDS7VAL> as she should know the latest status as if outside contribution may be helpful. I think at the moment any contribution would be voluntary - is that still of interest or are you hoping for a GSoC project?",
