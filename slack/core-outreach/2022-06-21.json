Familiarize yourself with the information on <https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org\/events\/bug-bbq> and <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/bug-bbq> (note these pages are still being updated).\n2. When joining the session, add (Facilitator) to your name on Zoom. Pin your video.\n3. The session will be hosted by Hadley Wickham, Lionel Henry or Gabor Csardi from RStudio. Ask to be made a co-host.\n4. Share this slide: <https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/17w-fBcCBnWesB-CbdPQ5-FNRzwWhEMsF9kzjm8Jll8A\/edit?usp=sharing>\n5. Create 10 breakout rooms.\n6. When people join, encourage them to watch the welcome video and optionally the Contributing to R tutorial. \n7. Encourage people to join breakout rooms to work together. It would be good if there were experienced contributors in the breakouts as well as the main session.\n8. Be ready to help people work out what to do next.\n9. Keep an eye on the GitHub for issues that need triaging: <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/bug-bbq\/tree\/main\/triagers#triaging-bugs>\n10. Be ready to send messages to breakouts, e.g. to remind people to ask for assistance if they need it, or to remind people to update the GitHub issues with any comments\/contributions.\n11. Close the breakout rooms ~10 minutes before end of the session to allow time for brief discussion of how it went at the end. Encourage people to keep working on their issues or to attend a later session.",
