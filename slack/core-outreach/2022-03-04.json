Pin message on welcome channel. Reduce channels that people automatically join and add description of all channels in welcome message. Have channel just for posting \"documentation\" posts? Think about channel order, to make sure welcome and docs are at the top - user numbers to name. (Heather, w\/b 28 Feb)\n☐ Contact Laura (RC marketing manager) to help promote next time (Saranjeet, w\/b 7 Mar)\n☐ Initial promotion on Twitter\/Slack\/mailing lists (Heather and Saranjeet, w\/b 7 Mar)\n☐ Optional pre-reading: chapter on bug review - suggest on Slack\/Twitter as thread?(Heather and Saranjeet, w\/b 7 Mar)\n☐ Prep for first session in more detail, i.e. skeleton for collaborative notes, test out activities (Saranjeet, w\/b 7 Mar)\n    • Poll (while people join): Did you come to the first session?\n    • Logistics (Zoom, code of conduct, etherpad, etc). More than one written room? Don't forget to mention captions.\n    • Discuss take-home activities from session 1 - if anyone posted a plot\/table\n        • Poll: did they sign up for Bugzilla?\n    • Poll: did they do the pre-reading? (One option: I already know about bug review)\n    • In introduction, give examples of good and bad bug reports (bit of discussion from participants with experience)\n    • Use Activity 3 from last time as Activity 1 for next time:\n        • Look at report that already has several comment (first part of the activity).\n    • One more longer\/structured activity - practice reviewing one or more bug, e.g.\n        1. Review the bug report against good practice. Does it have a reprex? Does it have session info? Does it OS\/machine architecture? Is the issue clear?\n        2. Confirm bug on their machine.\n        3. Diagnose cause of bug if possible (or discuss!)\n    • If we find anything to follow up on (e.g. a possible comment to add to bug report), post on #getting-started channel to discuss how to move forward.\n    • Allow more time for feedback\/discussion in the session\n    • Take home activity: repeat activity 2 on a different bug.\n    • In future, when reviewing bugs use #work-out-loud channel.\n    • Link to Contributing to R tutorial (<https:\/\/youtu.be\/CZmldTOdlRM?list=PL4IzsxWztPdnCC_kMCYKrd_t6cViMhBrD|https:\/\/youtu.be\/CZmldTOdlRM?list=PL4IzsxWztPdnCC_kMCYKrd_t6cViMhBrD>, <https:\/\/github.com\/gmbecker\/contributing_to_r_lesson|https:\/\/github.com\/gmbecker\/contributing_to_r_lesson>)\n☐ Follow-up promotion on Twitter and R-Devel Slack ?
