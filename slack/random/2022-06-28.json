Basically, each OS, and possible individual OS versions, would have their own pages (e.g. Linux Ubuntu 22.04 or macOS 13) with 1-2-3 instructions.\n\nThis can help R users stuck on HPC systems with very dated R versions, or, say Bioconductor users, who wish to install multiple parallel R versions (e.g. R devel and R release) so they can access both Bioc devel and release.\n\nJust a thought",
