As you might, expect he's aware  that there is a newer version of Mailman and that a migration ought to happen.

Although these hacks are somewhat documented, Martin estimates that it could more than a week of work to port them to Mailman 3 and the migration carries the danger of disruption etc. Given that subscribers can stop password reminders if they choose and moreover choose a unique pass phrase that is not used anywhere else, the benefit of moving isn't high enough to justify Martin spending the time on this.
