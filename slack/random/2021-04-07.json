                "text": "It would be great to explore how the CarpenPi infrastructure could be adapted for delivering R workshops in locations with limited internet access (and occasional electricity blackouts). For example, <https:\/\/forwards.github.io\/|Forwards> have delivered workshops in Botswana and Eswatini where participants had their own laptops, but limited internet access made it harder to share materials and install R packages. For this scenario, we might want\n\n• 1 x Pi for an access point\n• 1 x Pi for an CRAN server (probably using <https:\/\/CRAN.R-project.org\/package=miniCRAN|miniCRAN> to serve selected packages)\n• 1 x Pi to serve teaching materials as HTML slides (e.g. <https:\/\/www.heatherturner.net\/teaching\/intro-to-r\/|https:\/\/www.heatherturner.net\/teaching\/intro-to-r\/>) and\/or files to download\n• optionally 1 x Pi as git server\n\nThis set-up might also be interesting for local R user groups - not only could they run hands-on workshops off-line, but potentially R user groups could act as a hub to update commonly-used packages (a RUG leader updates the miniCRAN, RUG members updates their packages when they attend RUG meetings).\n\nIt's not too long before the next deadline of April 19, but this might be a suitable project for R Consortium funding if folks were intrested to work on this (<https:\/\/www.r-consortium.org\/projects\/call-for-proposals|https:\/\/www.r-consortium.org\/projects\/call-for-proposals>). There a funding calls twice a year.",
