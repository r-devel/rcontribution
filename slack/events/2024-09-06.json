                "text": "Slack was chosen as the platform for R Contributors Slack as it was the clear preference of <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/rcwg\/blob\/2dc203799b2efa339246af5f8b0a8b35a8e63fd7\/mentorship\/chat_and_q_and_a_platforms_survey.md|intermediate\/novice contributors> - exactly the people we aimed to reach out to.\n\nHowever, Slack has its downsides, some recognised at the time (e.g. not FOSS, chat history limited to 10,000 messages) and others that have become an issue since (chat history became limited to 90 days, from 26 August 2024 no longer possible to export full chat history for our records). Meanwhile Matrix has emerged as a new option, that some people are familiar with (e.g. adopted by ETH and other universities) and that may feel similar to Slack (similar concepts of channels, threads, emojis).\n\nThis task is to set up a test R Contributors space on <http:\/\/Matrix.org|Matrix.org> as described in the <https:\/\/matrix.org\/docs\/communities\/getting-started\/|documentation>. It would be great if someone already familiar with Matrix could be involved, but this is not essential for testing it out.\n\nThings to consider:\n\n1. Can we set up a space with rooms that are equivalent to our existing channels?\n2. Can we import our past messages (as a one-off, or perhaps on-going)?\n3. Are these features available?  \n   • Private rooms  \n   • Direct messages  \n   • Way to bulk invite people to a new room  \n   • Default rooms  \n   • Room description  \n   • Pinned messages (in room)  \n   • Bookmarks to key URLs (in room)  \n   • Ability to share small files  \n   • Ability to mark up code  \n   • Welcome message\/other way to share joining instructions or documentation for space (e.g. overview of channels, code of conduct)  \n   • Ability to email room  \n   • Ability to automatically post messages to room using Zapier or similar  \n   • Ability to share information via user profile (e.g. position\/affiliation, pronouns, country of residence, contact email)  \n   • Ability to require people to view the posting guide\/code of conduct before joining.  \n   • Custom emoji  \n   • Ability to set reminders (used by admins to remind of admin tasks)\n4. Can we encourage use of real name (as we do now) or are people's usernames already fixed?\n5. Can we ban people from the space if required due to (significant\/repeated) code of conduct violation?\n6. How might we make it easier for people to transition?\n7. How does bridging between Matrix to Slack work? Is this done on an individual basis?",
