When we asked about first time contributions on the rOpenSci Slack, people recalled the challenges and mistakes they made, but mostly how much they learned from and enjoyed that experience.\nIn this community call moderated by Hugo Gruson, our speaker, Yaoxiang Li will discus the importance of tests with respect to first-time contributions, and share best practices and advanced techniques for supercharging R package quality with testthat, Pascal Burkhard will discuss the basic git skills that can help to make a first contribution, and Sunny Tseng will share practical advice for making first contributions, common challenges and how to overcome them.",
