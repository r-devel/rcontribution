I believe that other keys usually don't include text but use symbols (arrows, shift, pgup, pgdown). Ctrl and Alt are not translated\". It looks like Chinese takes a similar approach\n        • Italian does not translate the keys: \"Tastiera: PgUp, PgDown, Ctrl+Arrows, Ctrl+Home, Ctrl+End,\". Most languages take this approach.\n        • Best to discuss among translation team for specific language if possible, to decide best approach. General guidance: don't translate unless these terms are commonly translated on the keyboard, commonly used in other technical documentation, or are simply a translation of the English word into the language script. (The latter advice because if people are choosing to see R messages in a non-English language, they may prefer to see everything in that script where possible).\n    • Suggested each team maintains a page on this wiki <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/translations|https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/translations> where they note agreed conventions for future contributors\/translators.\n• We explored Weblate a bit more for people that are new to it\n    • How to find the translations for different languages (<https:\/\/translate.rx.studio\/projects\/r-project\/#languages|https:\/\/translate.rx.studio\/projects\/r-project\/#languages>)\n    • How to register for an account (<https:\/\/translate.rx.studio\/accounts\/register\/|https:\/\/translate.rx.studio\/accounts\/register\/>)\n• Nozim is interested in starting an Uzbek translation. This would be similar to the Russian translation, so would not take so much work.\n    • Advised to work on Russian translation to begin with, to gain experience. New languages can be added, but it is good to have more than one person willing to contribute for sustainability - a full translation is a lot of work. Additions of languages with a large community of speakers (e.g. Urdu) are particularly welcome.\n    • Nozim notes that Uzbek would be very similar to Russian, so not so much work.\n• Ivan has some translations passed on from Alexey Shipunov (now deceased) that need to be committed to R core. How to progress?\n    • Suggested to contact Michael Lawrence, the R Core member now responsible for translations. If he is too busy, can try Mike Chirico or Gergely Daróczi from the R Contribution Working Group, who are active on the #core-translations channel of the Slack\n\n*Bugs*\n\nElla gave an overview of some related bugs that had been discussed on fosstodon.\n\n• <https:\/\/fosstodon.org\/@nibsalot\/110105034507818285|https:\/\/fosstodon.org\/@nibsalot\/110105034507818285>. From the thread on fosstodon:\n    \n    > dat <- c(5,1,3,0)  \n    > sum(dat, na.rm = TRUE)  \n    > = 9  \n    > sum(dat, <http:\/\/rm.na|rm.na> = TRUE)  \n    > =10\n    > \n    > This looks like a normal sum operation where anything that is not one of the allowed named arguments is silently swallowed by ... The logical is converted to 1L and added to whatever it also has. Perhaps a more interestingly case:  \n    > sum(NA, na.rm = TRUE, na.rm = FALSE). R doesn't warn or anything for duplicated valid named arguments and only uses the latest.  \n    > --- @<mailto:nibsalot@fosstodon.org|nibsalot@fosstodon.org>\n    \n    • Ivan: If we decide this is a bug, it probably exists in all functions serviced by do_summary() except mean(), i.e. sum(), min(), max(), prod(). SEXP fixup_NaRm(SEXP args) may need adjusting.\n    • Ayush:\n        \n        ```\n        > min(dat,  <http:\/\/rm.na|rm.na> = TRUE)\n        [1] 0\n        > min(dat,  n…",
