With help from <@U051BH4JSS3> we invited a range of folk, mainly building on previous involvement in R Contributor initiatives (e.g. the R Project Sprint, C Study Group, etc), aiming to get a range of experience and diverse demographics. Potentially if people are signed up to the Tidyverse Dev Day and want to swap into the R Dev Day that may be possible, but this can't be a free-for-all as we also only have limited R Core members attending (2 in person, 1 remote) and limited tasks prepared, so most people will need to have some experience of R contribution for the event to run effectively. Sorry we can't be more open and inclusive in this case!\n\nThat said, I do have one free slot left and I'm happy to offer that to you <@U062MDESA6S>, so please go ahead and register (note that 3 tickets show as available because 2 invited folk have not registered, I have to chase them up!).",
