The same version of R works fine with Positron or the terminal. I had the same issue with an older version of R-devel and an older version of RStudio (didn't note the version numbers unfortunately, but I think R-devel was from September).\n\n• Side discussion on getting RStudio working with R-devel in Linux - as noted at the end of the <https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org\/rdevguide\/GetStart.html#linux|Linux> section in the R Dev Guide, you can do the following:  \n```  \nexport RSTUDIO_WHICH_R=\"$BUILDDIR\/bin\/R\"  \ncd \"$TOP_SRCDIR\"  \nrstudio  \n```  \nIf you did not build R-devel, but installed another way (e.g. with rig), you need to find the path the the R binary to defined as `RSTUDIO_WHICH_R`.\n• HG: May need to get RStudio daily build to work with R-devel if something has changed that affects RStudio. [post-meeting edit: this fixed the issue HT had on macOS!]\n\n*Cross-compilation*\n\nIsabel has been working on cross-compiling for web assembly.\n\nWould be good to start a discussion on <https:\/\/stat.ethz.ch\/mailman\/listinfo\/r-devel|https:\/\/stat.ethz.ch\/mailman\/listinfo\/r-devel> or start discussion on #general channel of Slack.\n\nList of people in R Core: <https:\/\/www.r-project.org\/contributors.html|https:\/\/www.r-project.org\/contributors.html>\n\nPeople working on cross-compilation: George Stagg (WebR, <https:\/\/github.com\/georgestagg|https:\/\/github.com\/georgestagg>), Jane He (RISC-V, <https:\/\/github.com\/SiyaoIsHiding|https:\/\/github.com\/SiyaoIsHiding>)\n\nCould arrange separate meeting to discuss, or invite people to R Contribution Working Group meeting: Friday 15 Nov 2024, 3:00pm - 4:00pm UTC (see <https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org\/events\/|https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org\/events\/> for further details).\n\n*R Dev Day @ LatinR (online)*\n\nNovember 18 and 19, 2024, 5:30pm - 8pm (UTC-3)\n\nDetails: <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-dev-day\/blob\/main\/preparation\/LatinR2024\/LatinR2024_en.md|https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-dev-day\/blob\/main\/preparation\/LatinR2024\/LatinR2024_en.md>\n\n• hopefully registration will open end this week\/beginning next week on <https:\/\/latinr.org\/|https:\/\/latinr.org\/>\n\n*iconv bug*\n\nHG: Recent changes in iconv in R-devel are causing new bugs, that pop up as ERRORs on the CRAN checks. E.g.\n\niconv(\"<infinity>∞<\/infinity>\", to = \"ASCII\", sub = \"\")\n#> [1] \"<infinity>\/infinity>\"\n\nAs you can see, where only the infinity symbol was previously removed, it now also eats the following character, which makes my XML file invalid.\n\n• Tomas Kalibera made a change to iconv yesterday: <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-svn\/commit\/1d0822ffaaea49cae09e6b6baaf9883c966e5041|r-devel\/r-svn@1d0822f>\n• If still an issue after building R with this fix, mail reproducible example to R-devel mailing list rather than reporting a bug, as they are clearly aware of some issues. [post-meeting edit: building latest R-devel fixed issue!]\n\n*Cairo graphics bug*\n\nEK worked with George Stagg on <https:\/\/bugs.r-project.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=16721|Bug 16721> at R Dev Day @ SIP 2024.\n\n• proposed a change to fix the issue of white lines appearing in image plots in Cairo graphics, due to lines being less than one pixel.\n• Paul Murrell proposed an improved version, which EK plans to apply to all graphics devices for consistency. Paul also suggested testing with `make check-all` and the {gdiff} package, to check that bugs are not introduced in the examples from examples from 'graphics', 'grid', 'lattice', and 'ggplot2'. How to do this efficiently? Will focus on updating patch and running basic check first.\n\nWill be another R Dev Day @ SIP 2025, Oct 7-8, Newcastle, UK, with Shiny in Production 2025 taking place Oct 8-9. Registration fee applies for conference and workshops only, not dev day. Early bird registration will be available soon!",
