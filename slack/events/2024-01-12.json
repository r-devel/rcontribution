So we can remove the .git file to take it out of version control.\n• Instead we should make use of the SVN version control tools - need to look again at how to get this working.\n• Need to updated to latest version of R.\n\nHeather will work on adding\/curating issues to help focus work in the next month or so.\n\nPotential for a GSoC 2024 project even if we do some work in the meantime, also possibly a useR! 2024 talk.",
