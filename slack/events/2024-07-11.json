If you need to leave earlier, we understand; if you can stay on later, there will be the option to go out for dinner (self-funded), details TBA.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  For people staying near Salzburg main station, we recommend to get O-Bus 3, which runs every 15 min, with a journey time of ~25 min. If you want to travel together, meet Heather Turner at the Salzburg Hbf bus stop at 08:30 so there is time to buy a ticket for the 08:41 departure. We should arrive at the venue shortly after 9.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  There is still time to add issues to the R Dev Day GitHub repo (<https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-dev-day>), proposing tasks for R Dev Day @ PLUS. It is great if you have time beforehand to take a look at the tasks that have been proposed, to see what you might like to work on. See the repo README for guidance.",
