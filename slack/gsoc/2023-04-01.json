Using the Microsoft cpp dev-container was a pragmatic decision to modify a container image which is known to work well with codespaces, supports working with C, and may be a standard for other users of devcontainers.\n\nI see your point and agree. A smaller container may load more quickly in codespace and reduce the download time. It would be an interesting experiment to compare any differences in the user experience and how one would document and maintain a custom image in the longer term. An alternative might be to build on the existing rocker image which builds and installs R from source, see:\n\n<https:\/\/github.com\/rocker-org\/rocker-versioned2\/blob\/master\/dockerfiles\/r-ver_4.2.3.Dockerfile>\n<https:\/\/github.com\/rocker-org\/rocker-versioned2\/blob\/master\/scripts\/install_R_source.sh>\n\nIf this is something you are interested in then please do include your ideas in your proposal. I'm keen to see what we can do to help people engage with R development and am open to ideas :)",
