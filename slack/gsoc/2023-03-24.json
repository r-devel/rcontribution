I would continue to send occasional brief updates by email (once or twice a week, or when you have significant progress to report), assuming that the mentor will get back to you when they can. I can see you have  done the tests, so you might start working on the proposal (see the <https:\/\/github.com\/rstats-gsoc\/gsoc2023\/wiki\/application-template>). My only concern is that Neeraj is the only mentor listed for your project and GSoC projects should have 2, so it would be good to know if Neeraj recommends proceeding with a proposal (he has posted a few projects ideas). You might consider an alternative project otherwise if you haven't had a positive response from him soon.",
