I've thought about various constants from time to time, but the one I am \"wishing\" for is one found in Google Calculator, Desmos, Python, Raku, Java, Rust, .NET, and others, which is a circle constant, tau. I am requesting this because (1) it should be an easy implementation as tau = 2*pi (2) there is a major shift in use from pi to tau as the circle constant over the past decade, and (3) it would help us write clearer code in R. Thank you!",
