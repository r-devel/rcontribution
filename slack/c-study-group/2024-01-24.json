For example, I asked it “Could you please give me a hint on how to implement the `lock_pairs` function in tideman?” (I’m a little ahead - this is a session 3 problem) and it did indeed point me in the right direction. One of its suggestions wasn’t optimal (it’s an LLM after all), but it was enough for me to get the general approach, and realise how I could tweak it to something more efficient.",
