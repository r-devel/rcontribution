I also thought about working with strings for this, but since they hadn't been covered in week one of cs50, I decided to stick with just what we’d been taught there to that point. \n\nAlso, I took me a while to distill my code to the version I shared - even after I had a working solution, I refactored it three more times! I wasn't satisfied until I thought I had it as elegant and efficient as I know how. ",
