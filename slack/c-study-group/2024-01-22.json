Its probably overkill for someone like me but I do like the idea of a personal website. I personally lean towards free markets\/capitalism but I am genuinely concerned for our freedoms (in the Free software foundation and Electronic Frontier Foundation sense) which is why I want to get involved with open source in some capacity.  Two books that I have recently read that particularly have amplified my unease are “Rentier Capitalism” and “Technofeudalism”  so in addition to using all the conveniences of big tech I think it is nice to have some little pockets outside their purview.  I saw the link you shared on your site about how to use the “Fediverse” which was also very helpful as I want to start using Mastodon too. Anyway, this is all completely off topic so if you did read this thanks for indulging me.",
