I love the idea of an R Dev Guide book club, especially if it could also serve a bit as a working group for improving the guide as we go through it. Of the two options for C, I’d personally be very much in favour of CS50. I was part of the Modern C book club last time and found the book pretty dense, though slowing down the pace would help a bit. One thing that was particularly tricky for the book club last time was finding suitable, freely-available exercises that were well calibrated to each session’s text. That would remain a challenge, even with the slower pace. On the other hand, the CS50 sessions are expertly constructed, with matching exercises and labs for each session. There are also Codespaces to work in, eliminating the overhead of figuring out good editor and compiling configurations, which caused some issues in the last book club. Your proposed week-by-week breakdown offers a nice way of pacing the work too.",
