E.g.\n\n• Is it clear how you would contribute for each type of task?\n• Do the tasks map well to how bugs are handled in practice?\n• Are the recommendations for set up (accessing\/installing specific versions of R) suitable for new contributors?\n• Do you have any tips and tricks that would help people get setup or contribute?\nSuggested improvements\/pull requests welcome, from small changes in the wording to bigger changes in the documentation or the way we propose to run the event. Note this is a work in progress, there are no issues there yet, but the plan is to have GitHub issues corresponding to bugs on Bugzilla that are labelled by the type of contribution required.\n\nIf you would like to get involved in the organization or help out by being on the triage team labelling issues in advance\/during the event let me know! The event will be run from Thursday 23 June to Friday 24 June, in three sessions over the 24 hour period - I'll be adding an event page to <http:\/\/contributor.r-project.org|contributor.r-project.org> soon.",
