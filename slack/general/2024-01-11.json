Similarly for posit::conf it would be the day after the main conference: Thursday 15 August. In both cases, it is likely to take place in a separate venue, but within easy travel distance (e.g. 30 min bus ride) from the conference hotel, so you don't need to switch accommodation. Hopefully we'll have more to announce soon as we firm up the logistics.",
