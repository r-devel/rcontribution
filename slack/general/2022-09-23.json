That is why this program focuses on *people who belong to groups that are historically and systematically excluded* from the open software and research software communities and who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader open source and research software communities.\n\nIf you are selected as a Champion, over the course of a year you will develop a project, get training, and be mentored. You will also receive a small stipend.\n\n:calendar: You can apply until November 7, 2022 <https:\/\/ropensci.org\/champions\/#how-to-apply|using a form>. You can read more details in this <https:\/\/ropensci.org\/blog\/2022\/09\/22\/launch-champions-program\/|blog post>.\n\nAnd, of course, you can contact me if you have any questions. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nPlease share widely with people who may be interested.
