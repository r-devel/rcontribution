I think it would be good to time this for the first half of 2024. This gives us some time to organize and promote it and for people to plan it into their schedules.

I think it would be good to time this for the first half of 2024. This gives us some time to organize and promote it and for people to plan it into their schedules. We also have tentative plans for developer days at useR! 2024 (July) and posit::conf(2024) (August), so it could work well as preparation for that. We struggled a bit with the original timetable (as on <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/c-book-club\/>), partly because of the amount of material and partly because the book was quite a challenging read (often a lot of new concepts at once, that are not well paired with exercises to help understanding). So I think we would want to do something a bit different.\n\nHere are some possible options:\n\n:snail: Spread the Modern C material over 26 weeks (13 sessions every 2 weeks vs 8 sessions every 2 weeks last time).\nThis will giving more opportunity to digest the material and work on related practice problems (possibly from elsewhere). Suggested timetable:\n1: ch 1-2 - compiling and running, basic structure of a program\n2: ch 3 - flow control\n3: ch 4 - operators (arithmetic, logical)\n4: ch 5 sec 1-5 - basic values and data types\n5: ch 5 sec 6-7 - named constants and binary representation\n6: ch 6 - arrays and pointers\n7: ch 7, 9, 10 - functions, style, organization and documentation\n8: ch 8 - C library functions\n9: ch 11 - pointers in more depth\n10: ch 12 - C memory model\n11: ch 13 - storage\n12: ch 14 - more involved processing an I\/O\n+ 1 session on ch 14 of Deep R Programming (<https:\/\/deepr.gagolewski.com\/chapter\/310-compiled.html>) on R' C API.\nSessions could be participants presenting the material, as before, or presenting related practice problems they have worked on.\n\n:computer: The C sessions of CS50, Harvard's Introduction to Compute Science (<https:\/\/cs50.harvard.edu\/x\/2023\/>). 1 session a month.\nSeveral participants preferred this material to the Modern C book. It might not go in so much depth, but may be a better introduction. There are well integrated practice problems and labs, plus dedicated help forums. People would have the option to continue study and obtain a certificate via EdX (~$200, financial assistance available).\nMonth 1: C basics\nMonth 2: Arrays\nMonth 3: Algorithms\nMonth 4: Memory\nMonth 5: Data Structures\nThis could be paired with :zero: Month 0: Scratch, for people wanting to take the full course or :six: Month 6: ch 14 of Deep R Programming.\nSuggested work pattern:\nWeek 1: watch lecture (2.5 hr)\nWeek 2: watch shorts (6 x 10-15 min videos that expand on topics in the lecture) and do one or more practice problems\nWeek 3: do the lab\nWeek 4: meet to share solutions to the lab.
