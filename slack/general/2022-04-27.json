I have tried Docusaurus earlier and I think it goes completely well with the current problem statement for GSoD 2022.\n\nDo let me know what you think about this. Hoping for a positive response.\n\nThank you :)\n\nBest Regards,\nAryan Kenchappagol"

So in fact all the issues on the 2022 repo were considered for this year and as you noticed, the development guide project was the one we picked to make a proposal for. This is the one that was accepted for GSoD 2022 and we have writers lined up for this. Regarding the CRAN website proposal, we are not looking to use a completely new documentation framework, but merely update the current template to meet modern web standards. This would need support from the CRAN team and we did not get as far as trying to discuss it with them. So I don't think this idea is going anywhere at the moment.",
