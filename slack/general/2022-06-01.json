Your role will be to advise novice contributors as they try to make contributions during the event, e.g. answering questions on the process, discussing bugs and advising how to proceed.\n• Facilitator: R users that are familiar (or make themselves familiar with) the Bug BBQ format and can help get people started. Your role will be to welcome people, point them to the videos, guide them to a Zoom breakout room or Slack discussion, connect them to contributors that can help with more technical questions etc.\nBoth contributors and facilitators would also help with triaging issues on the Bug BBQ GitHub repo (<https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/bug-bbq>). For example, if a participant contributes a reprex for a bug, a Contributor or Facilitator would check it and update the label from `needs reprex` to `check in r-devel`, so participants know the bug is ready to be checked in R-devel.\n\nIf you can help either as a Contributor or Facilitator, please add your name to the relevant slots on this spreadsheet, making sure to set your UTC offset on the first sheet so you see the correct local times: <https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1xC4rL6aWSE-ITIPQME57XIw7-W7bfY0Lg8DocPLeZ-k\/edit?usp=sharing>.\n\nWe are particularly looking for Facilitators for Session 1!",
