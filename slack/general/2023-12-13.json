I have updated the macOS instructions to fix some issues that we noticed and made a few changes in the light of your comments. Note that we are following the recommendations of <https:\/\/mac.r-project.org> so if you have followed instructions there before, you may already have the prequisites installed. But I recommend reinstalling unless <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/rcwg\/blob\/main\/working_documents\/install_r_macos.md|install_r_macos.md> suggests this is unnecessary, to check you have the latest versions. It would be great if you could test these instructions out and let me know how you get on!",

                "text": "*Installing R from Source on macOS*\n\n2023-12-11\n\n*Prerequisites*\n\nSome details and notes are hidden by default - click the black arrowhead  \nto expand or collapse these sections.\n\n*Set up R installation directory*\n\nIf you do not have an existing version of R installed on your computer,  \ndownload the installer for the latest release of R from the <https:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/bin\/macosx\/|CRAN macOS  \npage> and install this pre-built  \n(binary) version with the default settings.\n\nOpen <http:\/\/Terminal.app|Terminal.app> and follow these instructions:\n\n1. Set `LOCAL` as a temporary environment variable to match your  \n    architecture\n    \n    ```\n    # Intel\n    export LOCAL=\/opt\/R\/x86_64 \n    ```\n    \n    ```\n    # Apple Silicon (e.g. M1)\n    export LOCAL=\/opt\/R\/arm64  \n    ```\n2. Make your account own `\/opt\/R` so that we can install prerequisites  \n    for building from source with the helper R script described in the  \n    next subsection.\n    \n    ```\n    sudo chown -R $USER \/opt\/R\n    ```\n    \n    _Details…_\n    \n    If this is skipped, you get errors when running  \n    `install.libs(\"r-base-dev\")`, e.g. “Can’t restore time”, “Can’t  \n    unlink already-existing object”.\n3. Add `$LOCAL\/bin` to your path\n    \n    ```\n    cat << EOF >> \/Users\/$USER\/.zprofile\n    # Add R bin directory to PATH\n    export PATH=\"$LOCAL\/bin:\\${PATH}\"\n    EOF\n    ```\n    \n    _Note if using RStudio terminal, or using <http:\/\/Terminal.app|Terminal.app> on macOS <  \n    10.15 (Catalina)…_\n    \n    The code above assumes you are using a Zsh shell (the default on  \n    macOS ≥ 10.15). If you are using a bash shell, replace  \n    `.zprofile` with `.bash_profile`. The type of  \n    terminal in RStudio can be set in Terminal Options from the terminal  \n    or in Global Options.\n4. Make your account own the R framework folder (created when  \n    installing R from the binary)\n    \n    ```\n    sudo chown -R $USER \/Library\/Frameworks\/R.framework\/\n    ```\n\n*Install prerequisites*\n\nFor the following instructions, run the code within R:\n\n1. Use the helper R script to install commonly required prerequisites\n    \n    ```\n    source(\"<https:\/\/mac.R-project.org\/bin\/install.R>\")\n    install.libs(\"r-base-dev\")\n    ```\n2. (Optional), install Pango for full Cairo support\n    \n    ```\n    install.libs(\"pango\")\n    ```\n3. Check if you already have Subversion installed:\n    \n    ```\n    system2(\"which\", \"svn\")\n    ```\n    \n    This will print a path where Subversion is installed. If nothing is  \n    printed, install Subversion:\n    \n    ```\n    install.libs(\"subversion\", dep = FALSE)\n    ```\n    \n    _Troubleshooting…_\n    \n    If this does not work, try installing Subversion via your preferred  \n    package manager, e.g. with Homebrew: `brew install svn`.\n\nFor the remaining instructions, run the code within <http:\/\/Terminal.app|Terminal.app>\n\n1. Install GNU Fortran (gfortran) from the binary at  \n    <https:\/\/mac.r-project.org\/tools\/|https:\/\/mac.r-project.org\/tools\/>. This version is prepared for  \n    specifically for R and will be used in preference to any other  \n    version on your system.\n2. From the terminal, install Xcode Command Line Tools\n    \n    ```\n    xcode-select --install\n    ```\n    \n    (If already installed, shows “xcode-select: error: command line  \n    tools are already installed”).\n3. Check if you have a current version of MacTeX installed:\n    \n    ```\n    ls \/usr\/local\/texlive\n    ```\n    \n    If the `\/usr\/local\/texlive` directory exists, you will see one or  \n    more subdirectories named by year, e.g.\n    \n    ```\n    2022            2023            texmf-local\n    ```\n    \n    If this check doesn’t show a subdirectory for the current year,  \n    install MacTex from the binary at  \n    <https:\/\/tug.org\/mactex\/mactex-download.html|https:\/\/tug.org\/mactex\/mactex-download.html>.\n4. Check if you have XQuartz installed:\n    \n    ```\n    mdls -name kMDItemVersion \/Applications\/Utilities\/XQuartz.app\n    ```\n    \n    This will show the version number or  \n    `could not find \/Applications\/Utilities\/XQuartz.app`. If missing,  \n    install XQuartz from the binary at <https:\/\/www.xquartz.org\/|https:\/\/www.xquartz.org\/>.  \n    *Restart your computer* for XQuartz (and components that depend on  \n    it) to work!\n5. (Recommended) If you are not already using a tool such as  \n    <https:\/\/github.com\/r-lib\/rig|rig> to install and manage multiple R  \n    versions, install RSwitch from <https:\/\/rud.is\/rswitch\/|https:\/\/rud.is\/rswitch\/>. These are  \n    third-party tools, not part of the R Project, but are recommended  \n    here as they provide an easy way to switch R versions.\n\n*Build R*\n\nRun the following commands within <http:\/\/Terminal.app|Terminal.app>:\n\n0. Retrieve R source code into `TOP_SRCDIR`, note that we retrieve the  \n    `r-devel` source code:\n    \n    ```\n    export TOP_SRCDIR=\"$HOME\/svn\/R-devel\"\n    svn checkout <https:\/\/svn.r-project.org\/R\/trunk\/> \"$TOP_SRCDIR\"\n    ```\n1. Download the latest recommended packages:\n    \n    ```\n    $TOP_SRCDIR\/tools\/rsync-recommended\n    ```\n2. Create the build directory in the `BUILDDIR`:\n    \n    ```\n    export BUILDDIR=\"$HOME\/build\/R-devel\"\n    mkdir -p $BUILDDIR\n    cd $BUILDDIR\n    ```\n3. Create `<http:\/\/config.site|config.site>` within the build directory to set some  \n    configuration flags as recommended by the <https:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/doc\/manuals\/r-devel\/R-admin.html#Prerequisites|R-admin  \n    manual>.\n    \n    ```\n    cat << EOF > <http:\/\/config.site|config.site>\n    CC=clang\n    OBJC=\\$CC\n    FC=\"\/opt\/gfortran\/bin\/gfortran -mtune=native\"\n    CPPFLAGS='-isystem $LOCAL\/include'\n    CXX=clang++\n    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$LOCAL\/lib\/pkgconfig:\/usr\/lib\/pkgconfig\n    EOF\n    ```\n    \n    If you are on Apple Silicon, also run the following to add some more  \n    configuration flags\n    \n    ```\n    cat << EOF >> <http:\/\/config.site|config.site>\n    CFLAGS=\"-falign-functions=8 -g -O0\"\n    FFLAGS=\"-g -O2 -mmacosx-version-min=11.0\"\n    FCFLAGS=\"-g -O2 -mmacosx-version-min=11.0\"\n    LDFLAGS=\"-L$LOCAL\/lib -L\/opt\/gfortran\/lib\"\n    CPPFLAGS=\"-isystem $LOCAL\/include -I$LOCAL\/include\"\n    EOF\n    ```\n    \n    _Details…_\n    \n    Some modifications to the recommendations in R-admin: `-O0` to  \n    enable debugging symbols and disable compiler optimisations for  \n    better debugging experience; `-mmacos-version-min` corrected [?]  \n    to `-mmacosx-version-min`;  \n    `LDFLAGS=\"-L$LOCAL\/lib -L\/opt\/gfortran\/lib\"` added so that liblzma  \n    (in `$LOCAL\/lib`) and gfortran libraries can be found. CPPFLAGS  \n    modified for Apple Silicon to link to the headers for liblzma.\n4. Configure the R installation with `--enable-R-framework` to install  \n    as an application framework so that we can switch between R versions  \n    with RSwitch:\n    \n    ```\n    \"$TOP_SRCDIR\/configure\" --enable-R-framework\n    ```\n    \n    _Working with multiple devel versions…_\n    \n    The code above assumes you only want to work with one development  \n    version of R that will be identified by the Major.Minor version  \n    number. To customize the version name use  \n    `--enable-R-framework FW=VERSION` where e.g. `VERSION=4.4-dev`. The  \n    configure options in <https:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/doc\/manuals\/r-devel\/R-admin.html#Prerequisites|R-admin  \n    manual>  \n    to define the location of X11 and tcltk libraries do not seem to be  \n    necessary.\n5. Build R :\n    \n    ```\n    make\n    ```\n6. Check that R works as expected:\n    \n    ```\n    make check\n    ```\n    \n    `make` will exit with an error if there are any problems.\n    \n    _Note if you are using RStudio terminal…_\n    \n    `make check` will fail unless you run `unset R_HOME` first\n7. Install the built version of R\n    \n    ```\n    make install\n    ```\n\nThe built version of R will now be your default version of R, which you  \ncan start by typing `R` in the terminal, or restarting the R session in  \nRStudio, etc. To switch versions, use RSwitch or rig, then restart your  \nR session.",
