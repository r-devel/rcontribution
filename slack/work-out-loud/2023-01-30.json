You can make these changes on the same PR, then continue following the git workflow to create a patch to submit on R's Bugzilla as a proposed patch. To do this:\n1. Get an account for R's Bugzilla if you don't yet have one (<https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org\/rdevguide\/ReviewBugs.html#preparing-to-review-bug-reports>)\n2. Go to the bug report on Bugzilla. Attach the patch file that you created from GitHub. In the optional comment, summarize your analysis of the bug and your proposed solutions to the issues that are implemented in the patch. It should be self-contained as it will be read by people that are not looking at this Slack or the GitHub mirror.\n3. Wait for your patch to be reviewed by a member of R Core - hopefully it will get accepted, perhaps after they modify it some more!",
