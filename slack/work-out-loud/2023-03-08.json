        "text": "Nice analysis <@U041CL6454N>, that does look like it needs fixing. Note that it is best practice to use `TRUE` rather than `T` , since `TRUE` is a reserved word but `T` can be redefined (see details in `?TRUE). Also, if\/when you create a patch, you should add spaces after commas and around `=`, i.e. `colMeans(mm, na.rm = TRUE)`.\n\nThe next stage is to test if fixing that resolves the problem. There are two options here:\n\n1. Check out the R Subversion sources; build R; make the change and test it.\n2. Check out the GitHub mirror of the R sources (<https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-svn>), make the change, source the relevant files and test.\nOption 1 requires more work to set up, but will pay off if you continue contributing to R. It also avoids problems with namespaces. See here for help: <https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org\/rdevguide\/GetStart.html>.\n\nOption 2 is relatively quick to do if you already use git, but simply sourcing updated source files won't work. We can use a simple hack if we are editing a top-level function or a method for a top-level function. E.g. here we can edit `predict.lm()` in `r-svn\/src\/library\/stats\/R\/lm.R`, source the updated file, then run `environment(predict.lm) &lt;- asNamespace('stats')` to use our updated function. However, if we need to edit a method for a function called by `predict.lm()` this approach doesn't work as the method dispatch will look for the method within the stats package first. There is a further hack we can do but it gets messy. So this approach will be enough to test your proposed fix, but possibly not a complete fix.\n\nLet me know which way you decide to go - I can help with the further hack for option 2 if necessary, maybe in tomorrow's office hours if you're around.",
