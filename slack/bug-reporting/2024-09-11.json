It appears BDR is on a tear with Rust powered R packages and is working on improving CRAN checks for them—which is great! Though it is also without reaching out to the community. Yesterday BDR introduced a new R function `check_rust()` into base R which could be improved. Having CRAN improve these checks would be great so that we do not have to play guess and check. So if we can contribute to them, that would be ideal. Right now it is a very one-sided and arbitrary situtation.\n\nA comment in there states `\"It is impossible to tell definiitively if a package compiles rust code\"`. This is not as drastic as it sounds. A rust library requires a `Cargo.toml` to be present. This should be the first check\n\n```r\nlength(list.files(\".\", pattern = \"Cargo.toml\", recursive = TRUE)) &gt; 1L```\nThen, due to CRAN’s requirements of\n\n&gt; The package should declare\n&gt; \n&gt; `SystemRequirements: Cargo (Rust's package manager), rustc`\nThis should also be checked. If rust is used and this is not present, that is a violation of CRAN policy. This is done in the newer CRAN-compliant `configure` checks (see <https:\/\/github.com\/extendr\/rextendr\/blob\/c698bf3445a6160fd99fff574ef61fd442a39e36\/inst\/templates\/cran\/msrv.R#L13-L22>).\n\nThe grep checks for the presence of `cargo build`. There is also the (rare) possibility of someone invoking the rust compiler directly with `rustc`. That could be added as an extra safeguard.\n\n`Compiling` or `Downloading crates...` checks might not be present if someone modifies their `Makevars` to include the `--quiet` flag. Due to the requirements to vendor packages, there may be another way to check that the package is compiled offline, though I am unsure what it is.",

This is not true. Rust code can be compiled if and only if there is a `Cargo.toml` metadata file. This PR changes the `check_rust` check to quit if the package does not contain a `Cargo.toml` anywhere under the `src` directory.",
