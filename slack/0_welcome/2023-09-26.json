Please describe.*  \nThis is a FAQ on the Slack and elsewhere (e.g. <https:\/\/fosstodon.org\/@multimeric@genomic.social\/110112514509758439|https:\/\/fosstodon.org\/@multimeric@genomic.social\/110112514509758439>).\n\n*Describe the solution you'd like*  \nThis may need to be a new chapter so people can find it, but it wouldn't be very long.\n\nThe standard advice is to float the idea on R-devel to get feedback from R Core. We might also offer the Slack as a place to get an initial reaction from peers (Do others think it's a good idea? Does it already exist? Should it be in a package?).\n\nWe can also discuss the wishlist on Bugzilla (bug reports may get labelled as wish list items if they are actually something the reporter wishes a function would do but it's not designed to do that; people may post wishlist items rather than bug reports but these tend to get ignored if not discussed first on R-devel).\n\nCase studies of successful and unsuccessful (but kindly handled) feature requests might be good.\n\n*Describe alternatives you've considered*  \nN\/A\n\n*Additional context*  \nN\/A",
