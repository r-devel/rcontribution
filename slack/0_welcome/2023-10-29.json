I am a little rusty so I may take a little while to contribute effectively.  I first used R 19 years ago and as fan of both C and scheme\/Lisp--and little else--I messed around in the C code base out of interest over the years.  I have used R continuously as a tool for my own work and hope that and my enthusiasm for the project will help me come up the curve speedily. Looking forward to working with you all.",
