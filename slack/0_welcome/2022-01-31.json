You're welcome to hang out here and see what goes on, but it's not where you should be looking to get general help in R. See this post for more relevant resources: <https:\/\/r-devel.slack.com\/archives\/C01ESS92UMN\/p1636966113010100> - I particularly recommend the R4DS Slack as a place for people learning R.",
