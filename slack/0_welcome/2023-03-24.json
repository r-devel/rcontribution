One reason is that the admins didn't have time to organize a community consultation on the project and prepare an application. The other reason is that we didn't complete our 2022 project in the 2022 season, so we are focusing on completing that instead. We already have writers in mind\/in place for the remaining work, so it is unlikely there will be any paid work on offer this year. Of course, happy to hear if you would be interested in making smaller contributions on a voluntary basis.",
