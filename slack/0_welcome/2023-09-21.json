I have been using R for about 15 years and teach it to students at the college level in biology courses. I really only have one contribution that I would like to make, which it to add a numerical constant, like `pi`. I can't seem to figure that out from the documentation on making contributions (focused on bugs), so I am hoping to seek some guidance here. Thank you [[:heart:R]].",
