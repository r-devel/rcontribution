Reporting this here before I forget for the next meeting.\n\nI haven't found any way to limit the notifications sent but I found that it is possible to <https:\/\/bugzilla.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/administering\/groups.html#creating-groups|create groups> with <https:\/\/bugzilla.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/administering\/categorization.html#assigning-group-controls-to-products|restricted permissions on Bugzilla>.\n\nIf I understood correctly the documentation such group could be set up with the following options:\n\n```\nProduct R:\nr-confirm: SHOWN\/SHOWN, CANCONFIRM, EDITBUGS\n\n```\n\nHere `confirm` would be the user group of people that would be allowed to confirm bugs. Who belong to that group can only be set by <https:\/\/bugzilla.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/administering\/groups.html#assigning-users-to-groups|the administrator of the Bugzilla>. The other flags on the same line are different permissions these users would have:\n\n• SHOWN\/SHOWN: just bugs shown (ie not security bugs). Not much documented\n• CANCONFIRM: Allows them to confirm bugs.\n• EDITBUGS: would allow to change the Os and other data related to the bug. I'm not sure if this also grants being able to close issues, if this is too much, it is not really needed to confirm bugs but maybe it is interesting to confirm versions, or limit the OS a report affects.",
