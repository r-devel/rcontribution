                "text": "Various people have expressed an interest in doing an <https:\/\/www.outreachy.org\/|Outreachy> internship with the R project (by contacting the R Foundation board, or asking on R-Ladies Slack groups). A blocker has been the high <https:\/\/www.outreachy.org\/mentor\/#mentor|Mentor requirements> (5-10 hrs\/week during 6 week application period, 5 hrs\/week during 3 month internship) and the need to find at least 2 mentors that can commit to this (see <https:\/\/www.outreachy.org\/mentor\/#coordinator|Coordinator duties>).\n\nHowever, I think we can make this work by co-mentoring projects (see <https:\/\/www.outreachy.org\/mentor\/mentor-faq\/|FAQ>), with the primary mentor being an expert (R Core member\/experienced contributor) that volunteers &lt; 1 hour\/week and the secondary mentor being someone that can commit to daily supervision. This worked quite well for <https:\/\/github.com\/SaranjeetKaur|@SaranjeetKaur>'s documentation project, with myself and <https:\/\/github.com\/lawremi|@lawremi> meeting with Saranjeet for 30 min each week and myself providing ad-hoc support\/documentation review in between (not daily supervision, but similar principle).\n\nOutreachy requires the community (R project in our case) to find $6500 to fund one intern, then we can apply to the general Outreachy fund for another intern. I can commit to regular supervision for one intern under my fellowship and hopefully could pair up with an R Core member\/experienced contributor relevant to project. If we had a second intern funded by Outreachy, we could potential pay someone to regularly supervise that project (again pairing with a member of R Core\/experienced contributor if additional expertise required). A suitable stipend might be $3000-$6000 for such a supervisor, bring the cost to $9500 - $12500 for two interns, which seems reasonable.\n\nIt would also be helpful to have <https:\/\/www.outreachy.org\/mentor\/#volunteer|volunteers> to help during the application phase.\n\nPotential projects, building on our work so far:\n\n• Triaging Bugs\n• Translating messages in a language that is currently not well covered\n\nDates: we have just missed out on the current round, so we're now looking at applying in January 2022 for internships running May-August 2022 (or waiting till the round after if that works better for potential mentors).",
