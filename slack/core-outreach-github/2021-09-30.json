However, we only ask them to report if something goes wrong. So people could be contributing without any recognition and perhaps there is a lot of time wasted with people running the same tests.\n\nTo encourage testing, we might set up a way to report test results. This would need to be done in a fairly standardized way, perhaps adding a line to a table, like the CRAN test results tables, possibly with one column for a free text comment.",
