But I left the windows and macOS bits out (I haven't checked yet if these instructions would work there).  \nIn the python book they also have on the list how to create patches and submit them.  \nI mention it at the end of the installation instructions.\n\nI assumed users have all the third party requirements of R. From the <https:\/\/r-contributors.slack.com\/archives\/C01E37KBY1H\/p1656458979952029|discussions in the slack>, it seems that how to install those third-party dependencies (or at least a list of them) might help R sysadmins. I'm not sure how to collect those besides looking to dependencies in r-base for Ubuntu or the list of the SUSE Linux instruction <https:\/\/github.com\/HenrikBengtsson|@HenrikBengtsson> mentioned.\n\nThe rest of the chapter is left as it was (but with minor changes: whitespaces and having each sentence in a new line).",
