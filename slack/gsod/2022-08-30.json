If there is a lot of content that you want to reuse, we may have to replace the CC-BY license with a permission notice as described - although I agree it is similar in spirit to CC BY SA, the CC BY SA would require sharing that license and not the permission notice above. Alternatively we'd need to ask R core if we can use a CC BY SA license instead, but that might need agreement of all R Core, so could delay things quite a bit.",
