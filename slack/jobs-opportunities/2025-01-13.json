Her team at Inria (National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology, France) are looking for a research software engineer to work initially on a fixed-term software project (till Sep 2026), with potential for the role to become permanent at the end of this term. This role has the benefit that *20% of the time can be dedicated to R Foundation and R community activities.* \n\nThe engineer will work on software development in AI \/ data science \/ digital health.\n\nThe job is located in Montpellier, France. French is not mandatory as the team speaks in English.\n\nSalary depends on experience.  Julie says that someone with Masters degree + 3 year's experience could expect around EUR 2600-2800 after taxes (EUR 3200-3500 before taxes). A PhD could count as experience. More precise information could be given on the basis of a candidate's CV.\n\nI'll put further details in the thread. For inquiries please contact <mailto:julie.josse@inria.fr|julie.josse@inria.fr>.",
