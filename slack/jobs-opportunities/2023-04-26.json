Please reach out to Elizabeth Roy (Senior Manager for Programs and Administration) with any questions or inquiries: <mailto:mps@simonsfoundation.org|mps@simonsfoundation.org>. Applicants must have a Ph.D. (or equivalent degree) in mathematics, astronomy or theoretical physics and have played a leading role in developing or maintaining scientific software in one or more of these fields. Awards may be hosted at any public or private Ph.D.-granting institution in the United States.
