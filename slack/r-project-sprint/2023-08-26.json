I was able to follow along the instructions in the README.md of the <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-dev-env|repo> from start to finish without issue. However, I did notice that the environment variables in my Codespace did not match those in the screenshots (see attached photos). Is this subtle difference something I should be worried about? I'm hoping I can use this tool during the sprint since I'm not planning to work on any Windows\/macOS-specific projects.\n\nThank you for the help in advance!",
