A couple of things I noticed about the  Catalan translations while preparing my talk for II Conference of R in Barcelona:\n• There is an issue with the \"base (R) files\" component on weblate - it looks like it is a duplicate of the \"base (C) files\" component. I think this is an issue we have detected for other new languages and I have raised it as a Weblate issue: <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/translations\/issues\/6#issuecomment-1814311873>\n• In the Catalan guidelines (<https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org\/translations\/Conventions_for_Languages\/Catalan-specific-translations.html>) you suggest that people use Poedit or similar to edit the automatic translations. This is fine, but it requires people to install and get familiar with another tool. It would be good if you could recommend people to use Weblate - it is possible to upload automatic translations either as suggestions, or as translations that need editing (see <https:\/\/docs.weblate.org\/en\/latest\/user\/files.html#uploading-translations>), which I think would fit well with your workflow. Poedit etc could still be mentioned as alternatives.",
