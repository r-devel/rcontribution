Currently i've finished to check my translations and also added the most recent commited strings (some message related to inplace droplevels() not translated because not yet in template). These are in <https:\/\/github.com\/rikivillalba\/data.table\/tree\/Spanish-translations|https:\/\/github.com\/rikivillalba\/data.table\/tree\/Spanish-translations>\n\nSome comments:\n\n• I've built and run the checks. Only 1702.3 fails because i'm in <https:\/\/github.com\/Rdatatable\/data.table\/blob\/b8d5f83270d45a47316a41259bedae63f3d2854d\/inst\/tests\/tests.Rraw#L10523|Buenos Aires> :man-shrugging:\n• I'm from Argentina. While I think there is not too much dialectal variation given the language, I use (i.e.) \"archivo\" rather than \"fichero\", the former being more common in LatAm, the latter in Spain. I use \"Usted\" the formal 2nd person. Base R has not dialectal variations of spanish.\n• I've been working alone not known wether other people is involved in data.table spanish translations, perhaps you know about.\n• data.table looks pretty \"verbose\" in the number and size of messages, each .mo file is about 100~150kb (uncompressed) in size so each new language will add to the ~5MB gzip package. ¿Can be them download by request?\n\nI hope these translations be useful. If it is so how to proceed?\n\nThanks!",
