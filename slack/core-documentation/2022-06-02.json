This follows discussion on the R-package-devel mailing list at<https:\/\/www.mail-archive.com\/r-package-devel@r-project.org\/msg07642.html1.4.3>. Customizing the vignette help index\nR provides two indices to the vignettes in a package (a) the browseVignettes() function and (b) the html index of vignettes and other user documentation available when you use help(package=xxx). The latter is built when the package is installed.\n\nIn some cases, customization of the html index is desirable. For example, currently the entries in the index are sorted by the vignette engine used to build the vignette and then by the file name of the vignette and a different sort order may be desired. Or additional documents may wish to be included, e.g., the purl()’d code from an “asis” vignette.\n\nPrevious sections of this guide indicate that if an “index.html” file is present in the inst\/doc directory at the time of the build, then a new “index.html” file will not be built. Previous sections also indicate how to add additional files to the inst\/doc directory. The following is then a summary of the steps needed to customize the html index to the vignettes in a package.\n\n1. Create a revised ‘index.html’ file in the vignettes directory. It may be easiest to copy an existing ‘doc\/index.html’ file from an installed package. The vignettes\/index.html file should be in plain html and can be modified to change the sort order or to add links to additional files to be available to users. Note that files are referred to using relative path names – follow the pattern in the copied file.\n\n2. Add any other additional files to the vignettes directory that are to be available to the user via the vignette help index.\n\n3. Add an ‘.install_extras’ file to the vignettes directory (don’t forget the leading period in this file’s name). This is a text file with the names of the files in the vignettes directory to be added to the inst\/doc directory. Each line can be coded as a regular expression. At a minimum, include ‘index.html’ to copy the vignettes\/index.html file to the inst\/doc directory.\n\n4. Check\/build the package in the regular way.\n\nThere is no evident way to modify the output of the browseVignettes() function; however, this function currently sorts by the vignette file name regardless of the vignette engine used.",
