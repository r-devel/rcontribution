We would like to have a steering committee, similar to last time: <https:\/\/github.com\/rstats-gsod\/gsod2021\/wiki\/GSOD-2021-Proposal> (scroll down or search for \"volunteers\" to find the section. If you are interested in this role, please let me know - it should involve a meeting once every two months or so, and contributing in-between by reviewing pull requests\/joining in the discussion on Slack to steer the project. A stipend of $500 can be made to a limited number of volunteers (I currently allowed for 1 in the budget but that could go up a bit).",
