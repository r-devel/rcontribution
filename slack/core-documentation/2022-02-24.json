I think the two strongest topics on the GSoD tracker are the Accessibility one (generated most discussion on the GSoD tracker) and the R Development Guide one (motivated by several issues on the rdeveguide issue tracker). The first may get diverted to other places (Outreachy, GSoD, independent work by Yihui perhaps) and the second has an interested writer (<@U01LM3R61HV>, who I would very much support). So we might want to focus on that one. Potentially we could have two writers again, especially if they are based in a low middle income country (not checked the budget arrangements this year).",
