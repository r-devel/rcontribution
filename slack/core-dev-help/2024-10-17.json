If I build R from a fresh checkout of the R sources (2024-10-16 r87241) and open in the latest RStudio (Version 2024.09.0+375), as soon as I try to run code in R (say `1` ), RStudio crashes. The same version of R works fine with Positron or the terminal. I had the same issue with an older version of R-devel and an older version of RStudio (didn't note the version numbers unfortunately, but I think R-devel was from September). Not sure how to troubleshoot further, so welcome any insights\/suggestions. (Can discuss in office hour in 5 minutes!).",
