However, do you have access to Linux and\/or Windows? If so, a useful contribution would be to test if you can reproduce the issue in <https:\/\/bugs.r-project.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=14843|Bug 14843> in R 4.4.2 or R-devel. I tried on macOS (with R 4.4.1 as R 4.4.2 was not yet out) and *could not* reproduce the issue as described on Quartz or Cairo devices. It would be good if you\/others could run the code in the bug report:\n\n• On Linux, passing `type = \"Xlib\"` to the `dev.print()` calls, and\/or\n• On Windows, running the example code as is (using the default `type` argument).\nand commenting on Bugzilla if you can reproduce the original report (jpeg\/bmp\/tiff have a red background) or you get the default background for the device (light grey on Xlib, not sure on Windows). If no one can reproduce the bug we can recommend that the report is closed as not reproducible (it is an old bug so may have been fixed by a change in R or the devices).",
