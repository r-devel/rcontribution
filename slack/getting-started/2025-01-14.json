Read the corresponding bug report on Bugzilla carefully as there was some discussion about how to fix the bug, with an approach approved by R Core member Martin Maechler at the end. This only requires editing the R code, which you can view on the GitHub mirror of the Subversion code repository: <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-svn\/blob\/4ce8bac8f0c4eca481519cccf7a47c6bcd4960cc\/src\/library\/graphics\/R\/text.R|text.R>. I recommend that you work on the code using the R Dev Container. See the <https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org\/r-dev-env\/|docs> for how to set up the container and work through the first few tutorials to learn how to build R and go through the basic R Contribution workflow, before working on the issue itself. If you have general questions on the workflow, ask on <#C01ESS92UMN|core-dev-help>; if you want to discuss the issue you're working on, got to <#C01EVRJRYA0|work-out-loud>.",
