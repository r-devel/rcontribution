These days it is probably best to start with the materials on <https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org> (I'll update the description here). Given your introduction, I think you might like to follow the full Contributing to R tutorial on <https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org\/tutorials\/> to get up to speed. Then I would recommend joining us at the next contributor office hour (I haven't sent out announcements yet, but the details are here: <https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/r-contributors\/events\/296721315\/>).",
