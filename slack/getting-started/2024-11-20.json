Gabe has outlined a fix, so the issue is on developing and testing the patch.\n• You can use the R Dev Container for editing the function\n*Translation dashboard issues*\n\nThere are several open issues on the GitHub repository for the <https:\/\/contributor.r-project.org\/translations-dashboard\/|Translations dashboard>, highlighted on <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-dev-day\/issues\/67|Issue 67>. At the moment this dashboard uses flexdashboard, using data that is retrieved using R scripts. So many issues involve editing R\/Rmd files, or standard repository files (README.md,  .yml files for GitHub actions, etc).\n\nThere are two that should be prioritised as they would make the GitHub actions more efficient - these only require editing R files:\n\n• <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/translations-dashboard\/issues\/46|Main dashboard: only update CSV and HTML when translations change translations-dashboard#46>\n• <https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/translations-dashboard\/issues\/47|Weblate data: only request data since CSV files were last updated translations-dashboard#47>\n*Translation*\n\nThere are ongoing translation efforts that you might like to join in with:\n\n<https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-dev-day\/issues\/71|Issue #71>: Translating R messages to Spanish. The base R messages are now translated as much as possible, but there is still work to do on the recommended packages!\n<https:\/\/github.com\/r-devel\/r-dev-day\/issues\/72|Issue #72>: Translating R messages to Brazilian Portuguese. Currently 70% of base R messages are translated to Brazilian Portuguese - would be great to increase this!",
