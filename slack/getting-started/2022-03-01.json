I am joined by research software engineer Heather Turner and statistician Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal to share the story of how the new R Development Guide brings a new and accessible approach for learning how to contribute to the R project itself, along with their vision of the upcoming Collaborative Campfires to inspire and grow the community around this imporant effort.",
