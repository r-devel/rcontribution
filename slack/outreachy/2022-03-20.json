I'm not sure it will change our idea of doing .tex to .md with pandoc, then .md to .Rmd with custom R code, unless there are plans for the R Journal to switch to .qmd, as the point was that this approach would allow us to benefit from the rjtools template. However, perhaps the code written under the Outreachy\/GSoC project could be written in a way that would make it relatively easy to convert to different .Rmd\/.qmd templates, so the tool could be useful to others with legacy .tex files to convert.",
